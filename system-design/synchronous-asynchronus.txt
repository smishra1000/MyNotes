When to Use Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication
Synchronous: Use when you need an immediate response and when the availability and

 performance of the called service can be ensured. For example, retrieving data 
 that the user expects to see immediately.

Asynchronous: Use when services can operate independently, and immediate feedback
 isn't required. This is ideal for long-running processes, high-throughput systems, or when you're processing events.

Conclusion
Synchronous Communication is simpler and provides immediate feedback, but it's 
more tightly coupled and can be less resilient.
Asynchronous Communication offers better scalability and resilience, but it's
 more complex and involves eventual consistency.
In a well-architected microservices system, you'll often find a mix of both, 
using synchronous communication for real-time data requests and asynchronous 
communication for background processing and event-driven tasks. Spring Boot 
provides robust support for both styles, making it a versatile choice for 
building microservices.
