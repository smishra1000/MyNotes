SVG in HTML
In this article, we will learn about HTML SVG. It stands for Scalable Vector
 Graphics, based on the XML format used to describe vector graphics. 
 SVG is popular and widely used due to its responsive web-design feature,
  it ensures the clarity of the graphics on any device and dimensions without 
  losing image quality. Another feature of SVG is you can easily integrate 
  SVG in your HTML file with the help of <svg> element. With the help of 
  JavaScript, we can manipulate SVG elements, and give dynamic effects.
