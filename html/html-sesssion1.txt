What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language 
used to create and design web pages on the internet. It was introduced by 
Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language. Since then, 
it has evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).

HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the 
link between the web pages and Markup language defines the text document within 
the tag.
