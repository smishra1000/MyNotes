In HTML5 there are two types of web storage API.
With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's 
browser.

localStorage
SessionStorage
localStorage: It is used to store data on the client side. It has no
 expiration time, so the data in the LocalStorage exists always till the user
  manually deletes it.
  localStorage.setItem("name", name);

Local storage has 4 methods:

setItem() Method – This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value. It is used to store the value in a particular location with the name of the key.
localStorage.setItem(key, value)
getItem() Method – This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the value stored with a particular key name.
localStorage.getItem(key)
removeItem() Method – This is method is used to remove the value stored in the memory in reference to key.
localStorage.removeItem(key)
clear() Method – This method is used to clear all the values stored in localstorage.
localStorage.clear()


  Session Storage: It is used to store data on the client-side. Data in the 
  SessionStorage exist till the current tab is open, if we close the current 
  tab then our data will also erase automatically from the SessionStorage.
