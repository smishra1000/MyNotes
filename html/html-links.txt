A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. 
Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another

HTML Link Syntax
Links are specified in HTML using the <a> tag.

A link or hyperlink could be a word, group of words, or image.

<a href="url">Link text</a>

You can also create bookmark anchors to allow users to jump to a specific section
 of a web page. Bookmarks are especially helpful if you have a very long web page.

Setting the Targets for Links----------------------------------
The target attribute tells the browser where to open the linked document. 
There are four defined targets, and each target name starts with an 
underscore(_) character:

_blank — Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.
_parent — Opens the linked document in the parent window.
_self — Opens the linked document in the same window or tab as the source document. This is the default, hence it is not necessary to explicitly specify this value.
_top — Opens the linked document in the full browser window.


Creating Bookmark Anchors----------------
Creating bookmarks is a two-step process: first add the id attribute on the 
element where you want to jump, then use that id attribute value preceded by 
the hash sign (#) as the value of the href attribute of the <a> tag, as shown 
in the following example:

<a href="#sectionA">Jump to Section A</a>
<h2 id="sectionA">Section A</h2>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...</p>
