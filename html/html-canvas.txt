What is Canvas?
The HTML5 canvas element can be used to draw graphics on the webpage via JavaScript

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format, suitable for creating graphics and interactive elements.

HTML5 Canvas is more like a blank canvas where you can draw whatever you want using pixels.
SVG is great for logos and icons, while Canvas is good for dynamic animations and games.
