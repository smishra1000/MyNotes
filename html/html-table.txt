 should cover. When a cell spans multiple rows, it occupies the space of those 
 rows within the table.    

 <table> 
        <tr> 
            <th>Name</th> 
            <th>Class</th> 
            <th rowspan="3">MVM School</th> 
        </tr> 
        <tr> 
            <td>Radha</td> 
            <td>10</td> 
        </tr> 
        <tr> 
            <td>Ankur</td>
