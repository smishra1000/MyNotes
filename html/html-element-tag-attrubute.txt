HTML ELEMENT---------
HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of markup tags. 
These markup tags are the fundamental characteristic of HTML. Every markup 
tag is composed of a keyword, surrounded by angle brackets, such as <html>, 
<head>, <body>, <title>, <p>

HTML TAG------------
HTML tags normally come in pairs like <html> and </html>. The first tag in
 a pair is often called the opening tag (or start tag), and the second tag is
  called the closing tag (or end tag).

  Most HTML elements are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an end 
  tag (or closing tag), with content in between. Elements can also contain 
  attributes that define its additional properties

  ex- <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

HTML Attributes
Attributes define additional characteristics or properties of the element 
such as width and height of an image. Attributes are always specified in the
 start tag (or opening tag)
ex- <input type="text" value="sameer">
Note----here are several attributes in HTML5 that do not consist of name/value
 pairs but consist of just a name. Such attributes are called Boolean attributes
 <input type="email" required>
<input type="submit" value="Submit" disabled>
HTML Elements Types
Elements can be placed in two distinct groups: block level and inline level elements

block element occupies 100% of the available width and it is rendered with a line
 break before and after. Whereas,
  an inline element will take up only as much space as it needs.

The most commonly used block-level elements are <div>, <p>, <h1> through <h6>, 
<form>, <ol>, <ul>, <li>, and so on.
inline-level elements are <img>, <a>, <span>, <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <code>,
 <input>, <button>, etc


The id Attribute
The id attribute is used to give a unique name or identifier to an element within
 a document. This makes it easier to select the element using CSS or JavaScript.
 <input type="text" id="firstName">

 The class Attribute
Like id attribute, the class attribute is also used to identify elements. 
But unlike id, the class attribute does not have to be unique in the document.
 This means you can apply the same class to multiple elements in a document
 <div class="box highlight">Some content</div>

The style Attribute
The style attribute allows you to specify CSS styling rules such as color, 
font, border, etc. directly within the element.
<p style="color: blue;">This is a paragraph.</p>
