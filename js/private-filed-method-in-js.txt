By default, members of a class are public. ES2020 introduced the private members that include private fields and methods.

To make a public method private, you prefix its name with a hash #. JavaScript 
allows you to define private methods for instance methods, static methods, and 
getter/setters.

class User {
  #name;
  
  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
  
  #generatePassword() {
    return "123
  }
  
  getUserName() {
    return this.#name;
  }
  
  resetPassword() {
    const newPassword = this.#generatePassword();
    console.log(`Password reset for user ${this.#name}. New password is ${newPassword}`);
  }
}

const user1 = new User('Alice');
console.log(user1.getUserName()); // Output: Alice
user1.resetPassword(); // Output: Password reset for user Alice. New password is zXm9nLoF
console.log(user1.#name); // Error: Private field '#name' is not defined in this context
console.log(user1.#generatePassword()); // Error: Private method '#generatePassword' is not defined in this context
