1. The let keyword allows you to declare a variable with block scope.
The const keyword allows you to declare a constant (a JavaScript variable with a constant value).

Constants are similar to let variables, except that the value cannot be changed.

2. Arrow Functions
Arrow functions allows a short syntax for writing function expressions.
You don't need the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly brackets.

Example
// ES5
var x = function(x, y) {
   return x * y;
}

// ES6
const x = (x, y) => x * y;

The Symbol Type

A JavaScript Symbol is a primitive data type just like Number, String, or Boolean.

It represents a unique "hidden" identifier that no other code can accidentally access

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

let id = Symbol('id');
person[id] = 140353;

Symbols are always unique.

If you create two symbols with the same description they will have different values:

Symbol("id") == Symbol("id"); // false
