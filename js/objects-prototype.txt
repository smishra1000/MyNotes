Objects are same as variables in JavaScript, the only difference is that an object holds multiple values in terms of properties and methods.

Create Object using Object Literal Syntax
The object literal is a short form of creating an object. Define an object in the { } brackets with key:value pairs separated by a comma. The key would be the name of the property and the value will
be a literal value or a function.
var <object-name> = { key1: value1, key2: value2,...};
var person = { firstName: "samer" };
