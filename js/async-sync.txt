By default, JavaScript is a synchronous, single threaded programming language. 
This means that instructions can only run one after another, and not in parallel.
 Consider the little code snippet below:

let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let sum = a + b;
console.log(sum);

What is Asynchronous Programming?
Asynchronous programming is a technique that allows your program to run its
 tasks concurrentlyAsynchronous programming makes your JavaScript programs run faster, and you can perform asynchronous programming with any of these:

Callbacks
Promises
Async/Await
