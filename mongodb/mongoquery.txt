MongoDB stores data records as documents that are stored together in collections 
and the database stores one or more collections of documents.

Document: A document is a basic unit of storing data into the database. 
A single record of a collection is also known as a document. Basically, 
It is a structure that compromises key & value pairs which is similar to the
 JSON objects

 Collection: It is used to store a varied number of documents inside the database. 
 As MongoDB is a Schema-free database, it can store documents that are not the same 
 in structure. Also, there is no need to define the columns and their datatype. 

 Database: The MongoDB database is a container for collections and it 
 can store one or more collections. It is not necessary to create a database 
 before you work on it. The show dbs command gives the list of all the databases. 

 Creating a Database
In MongoDB, we can create a database using the use command
use db_name

In MongoDB, we can view all the existing database using the following command:
show dbs

Creating a Collection
createCollection() in MongoDB â€“ In MongoDB,collection is created using createCollection() method.Collection name is passed as argument to the method.
Syntax
db.createCollection('collection_name')

use student_db;
//   To create Collection
db.createCollection('Student');
// To insert into the collection
db.Student.insertOne({ Name:"Sameer",Age:30} );
//To query the collection
db.Student.find();

Inserting many documents in the collection
db.myNewCollection2.insertMany([{name:"test1", age:40},
                                {name:"test2", age:20}])


In MongoDB, we can view all the existing collection in the
database using the following command:

show collections      

Delete the first matched document whose age is 20:
db.student.deleteOne({age:20})

Delete the first matched document whose age is less than 30:
db.student.deleteOne({age:{$lt:30}})

Remove all the documents
db.student.remove({})

Remove all the documents that match the given condition
db.student.remove({name: "sameer"})

The drop() method removes collections from the database. It also removes all 
indexes associated with the dropped collection
db.student.drop()



In MongoDB, the limit() method limits the number of records or documents that you want. 
It basically defines the max limit of records/documents that you want
db.student.find().limit(2)

--------------Dynamic Pagination Example--------------
We can make pagination dynamic by passing variables instead of hard-coded numbers.
 Here we define pageSize and pageNum to control our pagination.
let pageSize = 10;
let pageNum = 2; // Let's assume we want page 2
db.collection.find({}).skip(pageSize * (pageNum - 1)).limit(pageSize);



Basic Sorting by a Single Field
db.collection.find().sort({ field: 1 }); // ascending order
db.collection.find().sort({ field: -1 }); // descending order
