Matching values using $nin operator:
db.contributor.find({name: {$nin: ["Amit", "Suman"]}}).pretty()

Matching values using $in operator:
db.contributor.find({name: {$in: ["Amit", "Suman"]}}).pretty()

selecting those documents where the value of the salary field is less than 2000
db.contributor.find({salary: {$lt: 2000}}).pretty()

we are selecting those documents where the value of the branch field is equal to CSE
db.contributor.find({branch: {$eq: "CSE"}}).pretty()

 selecting those documents where the value of the branch field is not equal to CSE
 db.contributor.find({branch: {$ne: "CSE"}}).pretty()

 selecting those documents where the value of the salary field is greater than 1000.
 db.contributor.find({salary: {$gt: 1000}}).pretty()
