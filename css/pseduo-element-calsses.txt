What are Pseudo-Elements?
In CSS, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are two types of keywords that you can combine with selectors.
They are used to target the element's state or specific parts of an element.

Syntax
The single colon : refers to pseudo-classes
The double colon :: refers to pseudo-elements

a:hover {
  color: red;
}

p::first-letter {
  font-size: 9em;
}

A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

The ::first-letter Pseudo-element
The ::first-letter pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first letter of a text.

The following example formats the first letter of the text in all <p> elements: 

p::first-letter {
  color: #ff0000;
  font-size: xx-large;
}


The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.
