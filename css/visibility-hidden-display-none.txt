the difference between display: “none”; and visibility: “hidden”; right from the name itself we can tell the difference as 
display: “none”; completely gets rids of the tag, as it had never existed in the HTML page 
whereas visibility: “hidden”; just makes the tag invisible, it will still on the HTML page occupying space it’s just invisible.
