What is a Media Query?
In CSS, a media query is used to apply a set of styles based on the browser's characteristics including width, height, or screen resolution.

The media type refers to the category of media for the device. The different media types include all, print, screen and speech.

all - works for all devices
print - works for devices where the media is in print preview mode
screen - works for devices with screens
speech - works for devices like screen readers where the content is read out loud to the user


ex-In the CSS, we want to add a (max-width: 600px) for the media query which tells the computer to
target devices with a screen width of 600px and less.

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: #87ceeb;
  }
}

In this second example, we want to change the background color from blue to red if the device has a width between 600 and 768px. We can 
use the and operator to accomplish this.

@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: #de3163;
  }

Range of device target based on range to achive responsive desgine
  
320px — 480px: Mobile devices
481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets
769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops
1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens
1201px and more —  Extra large screens, TV
}
