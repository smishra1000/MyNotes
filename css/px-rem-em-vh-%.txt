CSS units allow you to measure and specify different property values. 
You use them to modify CSS properties such as margins, padding, height, 
and width to make them compatible with devices of all screen sizes

CSS units have two basic types:

Absolute units
Relative units


Absolute Unit----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolute units are fixed and do not depend on the size of the parent element or 
the viewport. Examples of absolute units are pixels (px), points (pt), 
and centimeters (cm).

Pixels (px)
px is an absolute unit of measurement used to specify length and sizes.
 px is a fixed unit 

Relative Units----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relative units, on the other hand, are flexible – and just as the name implies, 
they are relative to the parent element’s size, the viewport’s size, or the 
root element’s font size.


Rem (rem)
The rem unit in CSS stands for "root em". It is a relative unit of
 measurement that is relative to the font size of the root element.
  One rem is equal to the font size of the root element. The root element 
  defaults to 16px in many browsers, so 1rem is equal to 16px.

Let's look at an example to see how you can use rem:

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Best Practices for CSS units</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph with font size set to 2rem</p>
    </div>

html {
    font-size: 16px;
}
    h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
    color: #0077cc;
}
The h1 element is set to 2rem which means that it's two times the root element, 
the html element. 2 x 16px = 32, so the h1 element is 32px.


Em (em)
Similar to rem, em is a relative unit of measurement. But unlike rem, em 
is relative to the font size of the parent element or the font-size of the
 nearest parent with a defined font size.

 The p element is set to 2em which means it is 2 times the font size of the 
 parent element. 2 x 20 is 40px so the p element is 40px.


Percentages (%)
    Percentages are relative units that render an element relative to the size
    of the element's parent. They serve as a percentage of their containing 
    block and are always relative to their nearest parent.

Viewport height (vh)
    vh is a relative unit of measurement that represents the visible height
    area of the browser window.



What are Absolute Units?

Absolute units specify a fixed length value. It doesn't matter if the screen's 
width or height changes, the value will remain fixed.
Units that fall under this category include:
mm (millimeters)
cm (centimeters): 10mm makes 1cm
in (inches): 2.54cm makes 1in
pt (points): 1/72in makes 1pt
pc (picas) – 12pt makes 1pc
px (pixel)– 0.75pt makes 1px

For high-resolution media like print documents, it is recommended 
that you use cm, mm, or pt. For webpages, px is the recommended unit.


What are Relative Units?
Unlike absolute units, relative units are not fixed. Their values are 
"relative" to another value. This means that when that other value changes,
 the relative unit value will also change.

Units that fall under this category include:
% (percentage): relative to the size of the parent element
em (font size): relative to the size of the font
rem (root em): relative to the font size of the root element
vw (viewport width): relative to the width of the viewport
vh (viewport height): relative to the height of the viewport
