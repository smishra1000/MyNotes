What is the CSS Box Model?
The box model in CSS is a container that contains various properties,
 including borders, margins, padding, and the content itself. 
 These properties collectively determine the dimensions and spacing 
 of an element.

 Content: The actual data in text, images, or other media forms can be sized 
 using the width and height property.
Padding: Padding is used to create space around the element, inside any defined
 border.
Border: The border is used to cover the content & any padding, & also allows 
setting the style, color, and width of the border.
Margin: Margin is used to create space around the element ie., around the
 border area.
