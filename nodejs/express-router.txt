--------------------------------Routers
Defining routes in single app.js/index.js is very tedious to maintain. 
To separate the routes from our main index.js file, we will use
 Express.Router. Create a new file called things.js and type the 
 following in it.

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

router.get('/', function(req, res){
   res.send('GET route on things.');
});
router.post('/', function(req, res){
   res.send('POST route on things.');
});

//export this router to use in our index.js
module.exports = router;

Now to use this router in our index.js, type in the following before the app.listen function call.

var express = require('Express');
var app = express();

var things = require('./things.js');

//both index.js and things.js should be in same directory
app.use('/things', things);

app.listen(3000);

The app.use function call on route '/things' attaches the things router 
with this route. Now whatever requests our app gets at the '/things',
 will be handled by our things.js router.

 Routers are very helpful in separating concerns and keep relevant 
 portions of our code together. They help in building maintainable code.
  You should define your routes relating to an entity in a single file 
  and include it using the above method in your index.js file
