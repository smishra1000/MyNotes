ESLint: What, Why, When, How

What is ESLint?
ESLint is an open-source Javascript linting utility originally created 
by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. It is frequently used to find
 problematic patterns or code that doesn’t adhere to certain style 
 guidelines.

 Why use ESLint?
JavaScript, being a dynamic and loosely-typed language, is especially 
prone to developer error. ESLint lets you put guidelines over coding 
standard and helps you to minimize those errors. The main reason for 
imposing those guide is because every developer has her style of 
writing (like naming conventions/tabs/single or double quotes for a string)
. And, with different styling techniques, your codebase may look weird, 
more error-prone 


Install it
Prerequisites: Node.js (^10.12.0, or >=12.0.0)
You can install ESLint using npm or yarn:
$ npm install eslint --save-dev
# or
$ yarn add eslint --dev


Initialize it
After installing it, initialize it with the following command:
$ npx eslint --init
# or
$ yarn run eslint --init


Configure it
The moment you’re done with the installation and initialization you’ll have a .eslintrc.{js,yml,json} file in your directory. In it, you’ll see some rules configured like this:
{
    "rules": {
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
    }
}
