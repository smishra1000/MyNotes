Node.js EventEmitter
Node.js allows us to create and handle custom events easily by using 
events module. Event module includes EventEmitter class which can be used 
to raise and handle custom events

According to the official documentation of Node.js, it is an asynchronous
 event-driven JavaScript runtime. Node.js has an event-driven architecture
  which can perform asynchronous tasks. Node.js has ‘events’ module which 
  emits named events that can cause corresponding functions or callbacks 
  to be called. Functions(Callbacks) listen or subscribe to a particular 
  event to occur and when that event triggers

  // Importing events
const EventEmitter = require('events');
  
// Initializing event emitter instances 
var eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
 
// Registering to myEvent 
eventEmitter.on('myEvent', (msg) => {
   console.log(msg);
});
 
// Triggering myEvent
eventEmitter.emit('myEvent', "First event");
