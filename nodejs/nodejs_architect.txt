libUV:

Gives access to the operating system to perform tasks related to the 
filesystem or time scheduled tasks etc.

libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous 
I/O. It was primarily developed for use by Node.js,


V8:

Compiles and executes JavaScript source code, handles memory allocation 
for objects, and garbage collects objects it no longer needs.

As of now V8 has moved away from JIT (Just In Time) compiler to
 interpreted

These are the main functionalities of the V8 engine :-

Compiles and executes JS code
Handling call stack
Managing memory allocation for objects
Garbage collection — of objects which are no longer in use
Provide all the data types, operators, objects and functions

node.js:

A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

The thing is that in the early days of web, Javascript was intended to
 run only on the browser for client-side interactions. But slowly and
  gradually (after Google’s v8 engine) people started using Javascript 
  out of the browser and to replicate the browser environment outside 
  an actual browser NodeJS was released.

NodeJS is proficient with internet fundamentals such as TCP, HTTP etc. 
which made it a good choice for writing server-side code as well.
