A list of Third party middleware for Express is available here.

body-parser
This is used to parse the body of requests which have payloads attached 
to them. To mount body parser, we need to install it using
 npm install --save body-parser and to mount it, include the following 
 lines in your index.js −

var bodyParser = require('body-parser');

//To parse URL encoded data
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }))

//To parse json data
app.use(bodyParser.json())
