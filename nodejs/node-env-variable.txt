How to Use DotEnv
DotEnv is a lightweight npm package that automatically loads environment 
variables from a .env file into the process.env object.

To use DotEnv, first install it using the command: npm i dotenv. 
Then in your app, require and configure the package like this:

 require('dotenv').config().


 Once you have DotEnv installed and configured, make a file called .env 
 at the top level of your file structure. This is where you will create
  all of your environment variables, written in thr NAME=value format. 
  For example, you could set a port variable to 3000 like this:
   PORT=3000.

You can declare multiple variables in the .env file. For example, 
you could set database-related environment variables like this:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=password
