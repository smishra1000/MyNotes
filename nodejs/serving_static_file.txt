Serving static files in Express
To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, 
use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express.

For example, use the following code to serve images, CSS files, and 
JavaScript files in a directory named public:

app.use(express.static('public'))

Now, you can load the files that are in the public directory:

http://localhost:3000/images/kitten.jpg
http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
http://localhost:3000/js/app.js
http://localhost:3000/images/bg.png
http://localhost:3000/hello.html

To use multiple static assets directories, call the express.static middleware function multiple times:

app.use(express.static('public'))
app.use(express.static('files'))
