In Node.js Application, a Module can be considered as a block of code that 
provide a simple or complex functionality that can communicate with 
external application. Modules can be organized in a single file or a collection
 of multiple files/folders.it provides reusability
Nodejs uses the CommonJS Module standard implementation in its module ecosystem. 
Types of Modules:  In Nodejs, there is 3 type of modules namely

--------------------------Core Modules
Core Modules:  Node.js comes with dozens of built-in modules. These built-in 
modules are sometimes referred to as core modules. The module system is built
 around the require function. This function is used to load a module and get 
 access to its contents. require is a global variable provided to all your 
 Node.js scripts, so you can use it anywhere you like
Syntax for Importing Module: 

const module = require("Name_of_Module_to_be_imported");
How to use Core Module: You can directly use the Nodejs core module in
 your application without any installation. Let’s see an example of the 
 file system (fs) module to handle the files in the application. 
 // Working code of fs module
const fs = require('fs'); // Import fs module
fs.writeFileSync('notes.txt', 'i am sameer');
some core modules are----fs,http,https,path,url,os,dns
------------------------Local Modules 
 local modules are created locally in your Node.js application. Let’s create a
  simple calculating module that calculates various operations. Create a 
  calc.js file that has the following code: 
filename-calc.js
exports.add = function (x, y) {
    return x + y;
};
 
exports.sub = function (x, y) {
    return x - y;
};
 
exports.mult = function (x, y) {
    return x * y;
};
 
exports.div = function (x, y) {
    return x / y;
};
create index.js and load created local module here uisng require keywords
Note---When we want to export a single class/variable/function from one module 
to another module, we use module.exports.
When we want to export multiple variables/functions from one module to another, we use exports.
const calculator = require('./calc');
let x = 50, y = 10;
console.log("Addition of 50 and 10 is "
             + calculator.add(x, y));


---------------Third-Party Modules
Third-party modules can be installed from the NPM (Node Package Manager) available online. 

Firstly we need to initialize the npm using the npm init command before npm 
can be used. It creates a package.json file in the root directory and it 
stores all the information about the third-party module that we have installed
 as a dependency. 
 Installing an NPM module:
npm install "module_name"
Examples of Third-Party Module: 
npm install express
