There are two different approaches to Managing Sessions in an applications

1>Session or Cookies based approach(statefull)
In this approach, session Ids are stored in a session DB and the server 
always needs to verify the session Id hence it is stateful which takes 
a lot of overhead on the server if there are too many sessions being used 
in the application

2> Token(JSON Web Tokens) based approach(stateless)

JSON web token(JWT) is JSON Object which is used to securely transfer 
information over the web(between two parties). It is generally used 
for authentication systems and can also be used for information exchange.

This is used to transfer data with encryption over the internet also 
these tokens can be more secured by using an additional signature

In this approach, the server authenticates the client and generates the 
JWT token, and sends it to the client. Then the client sends the JWT token
 in the Authorization header on every request and the server does not 
 maintain any state hence it is stateless and less overhead. JWT tokens 
 are called Bearer tokens because all the information about the Bearer(User) 
 is self-contained inside the token
