The express.json() function is a built-in middleware function in Express.
 It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on 
 body-parser. 

 app.use(express.json());
 
app.post('/', function (req, res) {
    console.log(req.body.name)
    res.end();
})

// Without this middleware 
// app.use(express.json()); 
app.post('/', function (req, res) {
    console.log(req.body.name)
    res.end();
})

 Now make a POST request to http://localhost:3000/ with header set to
  ‘content-type: application/json’ and body {"name:"sameer"}, then you 
  will see the following output on your console:

Server listening on PORT 3000
TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
